# Sales Effectiveness Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data and building a machine learning model to evaluate sales effectiveness. The goal is to identify patterns that influence sales outcomes and support data-driven decision-making for improving sales performance.

---

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze historical sales data and build a predictive model that can classify or predict sales effectiveness based on available features such as customer details, product information, and sales-related attributes.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset (`project sales.csv`) contains structured sales-related data
- Each row represents a sales record
- Features include sales attributes relevant to customer behavior and performance
- Target variable represents sales outcome or effectiveness

(Note: The dataset is used for educational and learning purposes.)

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Inspected dataset structure, size, and data types  
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies  
- Analyzed distributions of numerical features  
- Studied relationships between sales features and outcomes  

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing or inconsistent values  
- Encoded categorical variables where required  
- Scaled numerical features for better model performance  
- Split data into training and testing sets  

---

## Machine Learning Models
The following classification models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree / Random Forest  

---

## Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using standard classification metrics:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

The best-performing model was selected based on balanced performance across evaluation metrics.

---

## Results
The final model provides insights into factors influencing sales effectiveness and can help businesses improve sales strategies and decision-making.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Data quality and missing values  
- Feature selection for optimal performance  
- Choosing an appropriate model for sales prediction  

These challenges were addressed through preprocessing, feature engineering, and model comparison.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow applied to sales analytics. It highlights how data-driven models can be used to evaluate and improve sales effectiveness.
